# CogniMemora-Ally
A chatbot to help the elderly suffering through Alzheimers and Dementia, by storing their earlier conversations in memory and accessing it later to initiate personalized and intimate conversations with the patient.
## Problem Statement
Often times, Alzheimers and Dementia patients remember little snippets of their lives, only for short spans of time. For patients who are surrounded by family and friends,they are constantly reminded of their past lives through conversations. But more often than not, families cannot devote enough time and attention to the elderly, leading to even faster memory deterioration and loneliness. To counter with that, we have created a conversational, memory based ChatBot
